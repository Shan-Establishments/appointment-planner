# Appointment Planner App 
This is an independent off-project via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path).
In this project I created an app that uses functional React components that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: to view and add your contacts and to view and add your appointments.

You can view the app [here](https://serene-pasca-f03411.netlify.app/contacts)

### Technologies used
+ React
+ Javascript
+ HTML
+ CSS

### How to use the application
###### In order to protect your sensitive data I suggest that all the information that is placed into the application is false

1. Place fake name, phone number and email in the Contact Page Form
2. Submit the form, data will be sent to the client server 
3. Add the name, data and time your appointment will take place
>    + Please note that you will be unable to place a date before the current date and you will not be able to use the contacts slo until you submitted your contatcs form
4. Once you completed the form submit your application

Remember this is still a working progress so not everything can be perfect.
